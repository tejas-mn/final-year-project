        "about" : "Early blight (EB) is a disease of potato caused by the fungus Alternaria solani. It is found wherever potatoes are grown. The disease primarily affects leaves and stems, but under favorable weather conditions, and if left uncontrolled, can result in considerable defoliation and enhance the chance for tuber infection. Premature defoliation may lead to considerable reduction in yield. The disease can also be severe on tomatoes, and can occur on other solanaceous crops and weeds.",

        "about" : "Late blight is a disease which is common in solanaceous plants like potatoes, tomatoes, etc. It is caused by an oomycete pathogen, i.e., Phytophthora infestans. Late blight in a potato is a lethal disease which can have the potential to devastate the crop. It can attack the crop at any stage and can infect the foliage and tubers. The initial symptoms are visible with small spots on the potato that appear circular and are light to dark green in colour. This is a destructive disease, which is why it becomes vital to understand the symptoms and manage them in the early stages.",
